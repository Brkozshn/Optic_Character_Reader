The data we will work on is ICDAR 2015 italic text data. Downloading this data should be done from https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4&com=downloads. First of all, you need to register to the system with your e-mail address. Afterwards, go to the "Task 4.4: End to End (2015 edition)" section from this address and;

### Training Set Images (88.5MB).
### Training Set Localization and Transcription Ground Truth (157KB).
### Test Set Images (43.3MB).
### Test Set Ground Truth (244Kb).
You need to download its items by clicking. After that;

#### Copy the contents of Training Set Images to the train_img folder,
#### Transfer the contents of Trainin Set Localization and Transcription Ground Truth to the train_gt folder,
#### Transfer the contents of Test Set Images to the test_img folder,
You need to extract the contents of Test Set Ground Truth into the test_gt folder and put the folders you created into a folder named ICDAR_2015.
You need to upload the ICDAR_2015 folder into the OCR folder you created in the drive. Since the uploading to Drive part may take some time, it might be time to take a break here to grab a cup of tea or coffee :)
